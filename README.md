# iOS-ImageEditor 


-- Here we have a project with very helpful features for image editing as mentioned below. --

1. Create image with text where we can set different properties to the image.

2. Resize an image

3. Crop an image

4. Set hue saturation brightness alpha for an image.

5. We can use these classes by adding bridging-header.h file in Swift project

Hope this helps.
